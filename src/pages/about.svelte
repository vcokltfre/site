    Hey, I'm vcokltfre (call me vco or Alec). I'm mostly a moderator and Python developer, but I
    dabble in web development often enough to probably be considered a full stack dev just about
    kind of sort of maybe. I'm a big fan of Svelte currently, and I'm trying to get better at web
    development in general (this website is even mobile friendly, which is a first for me, since my
    normal technique to making mobile friendly sites is to just not!).
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been programming on and off for about 9 years as of the time of writing this, as I started
    back when I was 9 with some awful Python 2 code on a first generation Raspberry Pi. Since then
    I've learned a lot about programming and tech, and am now interested in things like servers,
    networking, and infrastructure in general - especially chaos engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition as I mentioned previously I do some moderation on Discord for servers including GTA
    Online, Minecraft@Home, and Nextcord. I like writing moderation tooling for these servers, and
    also work on projects related to detecting phishing to remove it automatically.

    That's probably about it for the basics of who I am and what I do. I'd make this page more
    interesting but it feels right for it to just be a simple few paragraphs of information.
